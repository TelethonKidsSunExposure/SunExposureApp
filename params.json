{"name":"UV Buddy","tagline":"Written at #HealthHackPerth - a weekend hackathon to solve health industry problems.","body":"### The Hackathon\r\nThe hackathon #HealthHackPerth ran on the weekend of 23-25th October and gathered a number of data scientists, developers and health professionals to solve a series of problems plaguing the health profession.\r\n\r\n### The Problem\r\nThe problem that UV buddy was intended to solve was that it is very difficult to find accurate, tailored information for how much sun exposure you and your kids should get each day. There are rough guides based on the UV forecast available online but how this varies with skin type is rarely included and the number tends to conservatively assume pale skin. At the same time, there are surveys you can take to work out your skin type but through testing they are inaccurate and tend to ask questions that children are unable to answer (e.g. \"How easily do you blister in the sun\" and \"How often do you tan\").\r\n\r\nThe Telethon Kids Institute is currently researching algorithms related to extracting skin type from images. This data and algorithm was not available yet for the weekend.\r\n\r\n### The Hack\r\nOn the weekend @macca2805, @bringer128 and @vidyajambu worked together to design and prototype an app that could be used to work out how much sun exposure you and your family should get. We started by creating a User Story Map of the user flow, then making PoPs (Prototypes on Paper). We then pulled up the fantastic https://proto.io to prototype the look and feel and user flow.\r\n\r\nAs a team we then found that we had enough time to get a start on an Android app, which is stored at this GitHub. On the weekend we accomplished the Onboarding process of getting a user to photograph their skin and show them a hardcoded results page with the recommended time, and some example further screens of potential future features.\r\n\r\n### The Future\r\nTo enable a parent to track their whole family's sun exposure it should be possible for them to add multiple \"profiles\" of users with their own skin types and view the recommended sun exposure for all profiles at once.\r\n\r\nTo enable a teacher to track an entire classroom the app could include a \"bulk\" image capture feature, enabling the teacher to take a series of photos and tie them to student names rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe Telethon Kids Institute is currently working on an getting a data-driven skin type scale from a variety of skin types and an algorithm for extracting the skin type from an image. The intention is that this will be integrated into this application.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) has daily forecasts of UV data (http://www.bom.gov.au/uv/). Their FTP site has this data in text files that are computer-parseable and could be included in this app.\r\n\r\nARPANSA (Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency) has a realtime feed of current UV data for major cities in Australia. This data could be included in this app to give an idea of how much time could be spent in the sun _now_.\r\n\r\nSmart watches such as the Microsoft Band and similar IoT devices have UV sensors in them. Integration between the phone app and one of these devices could provide the opportunity for immediate warnings of high UV exposure based on skin type.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
