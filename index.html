<p>The hackathon #HealthHackPerth ran on the weekend of 23-25th October and gathered a number of data scientists, developers and health professionals to solve a series of problems plaguing the health profession.</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-problem" class="anchor" href="#the-problem" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Problem</h3>

<p>The problem that UV buddy was intended to solve was that it is very difficult to find accurate, tailored information for how much sun exposure you and your kids should get each day. There are rough guides based on the UV forecast available online but how this varies with skin type is rarely included and the number tends to conservatively assume pale skin. At the same time, there are surveys you can take to work out your skin type but through testing they are inaccurate and tend to ask questions that children are unable to answer (e.g. "How easily do you blister in the sun" and "How often do you tan").</p>

<p>The Telethon Kids Institute is currently researching algorithms related to extracting skin type from images. This data and algorithm was not available yet for the weekend.</p>

<a id="the-hack" class="anchor" href="#the-hack" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Hack</h3>

<p>On the weekend <a href="https://github.com/macca2805" class="user-mention">@macca2805</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bringer128" class="user-mention">@bringer128</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vidyajambu" class="user-mention">@vidyajambu</a> worked together to design and prototype an app that could be used to work out how much sun exposure you and your family should get. We started by creating a User Story Map of the user flow, then making PoPs (Prototypes on Paper). We then pulled up the fantastic <a href="https://proto.io">https://proto.io</a> to prototype the look and feel and user flow.</p>

<p>As a team we then found that we had enough time to get a start on an Android app, which is stored at this GitHub. On the weekend we accomplished the Onboarding process of getting a user to photograph their skin and show them a hardcoded results page with the recommended time, and some example further screens of potential future features.</p>
