# SunExposureApp
Written at #HealthHackPerth - a weekend hackathon to solve health industry problems.

# The Problem Statement
There are quite a few resources out there that recommend safe sun exposure levels to generate the right amounut of Vitamin D. However, most of these resources don't take into account the effect of skin type on your sun exposure.

There are other resources such as the Fitzpatrick Skin Type assessment for finding someone's skin type unfortunately that assessment was made in the 1980s and asks questions that are not appropriate for children such as "How easily do you tan?". The results tend to be quite inaccurate too.

# The Purpose
This app is intended to allow a user to take a photo of their skin to measure their skin type and get a personalised view of their recommended sun exposure each day based on the current and forecasted UV index. We also want a way to allow a parent or teacher to track the skin type of multiple children.
